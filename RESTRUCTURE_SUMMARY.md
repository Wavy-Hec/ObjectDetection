│       ├── task6_testing.md    # MOVED from root
│       └── task7_demo.md       # MOVED from root
│
├── src/                        # NEW - Source code directory
│   └── detector.py             # MOVED from root
│
└── tests/                      # NEW - Test files (empty for now)
```

### 2. Created New Documents

#### PAD.md (Project Architecture Document)
- Complete system architecture
- Technology stack and dependencies
- Design decisions with rationale
- Data flow and component interactions
- Performance targets
- Extension points
- Testing strategy

#### README.md
- Project overview and status
- Quick start guide
- Development workflow
- Usage examples
- Dependencies and requirements
- Performance targets
- Project documentation index

#### Templates
- **PRD_template.md**: Template for feature requirements
- **task_template.md**: Template for task specifications

#### Commands
- **design.md**: Command/prompt for design phase
- **plan.md**: Command/prompt for planning phase
- **implement.md**: Command/prompt for implementation phase
- **validate.md**: Command/prompt for validation phase

#### Post-Development Analysis
- **feature-1/post_development_analysis.md**: 
  - What was built
  - Process analysis
  - Lessons learned
  - Updates to templates/commands
  - Metrics and time tracking
  - Action items for feature-2
  - Recommendations for future iterations

### 3. Reorganized Existing Files

**Moved to feature-1/:**
- PRD.md
- design.md
- plan.md

**Moved to feature-1/tasks/:**
- tasks_README.md
- task6_testing.md
- task7_demo.md

**Moved to src/:**
- detector.py

**Deleted from root:**
- All duplicates after moving

## Key Improvements

### Process
1. ✅ Proper directory structure matching requirements
2. ✅ Templates for consistency across features
3. ✅ Commands for each development phase
4. ✅ Feature-specific subdirectories
5. ✅ Clear separation of concerns

### Documentation
1. ✅ PAD as architectural source of truth
2. ✅ Comprehensive README
3. ✅ Post-development analysis
4. ✅ Templates for future features
5. ✅ Command guides for AI-assisted development

### Organization
1. ✅ Source code in src/
2. ✅ Tests in tests/
3. ✅ Feature work in feature-X/
4. ✅ Templates and commands at root
5. ✅ Clear, navigable structure

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked
- Having clear requirements in PRD helped guide development
- Modular design made code reusable
- Good documentation in code (docstrings, type hints)

### What Didn't Work
- Started without proper directory structure
- Worked directly on main branch (should use feature branches)
- No comprehensive test suite
- Skipped validation phase

### For Next Time
1. **Start with structure**: Create directories and templates first
2. **Use feature branches**: Never work directly on main
3. **Follow commands**: Use command files for each phase
4. **Test continuously**: Write tests alongside code
5. **Validate formally**: Complete validation before marking feature done

---

## Checklist for Feature-1 Completion

### Required Deliverables
- ✅ Complete iteration of the process
- ✅ Post-development analysis
- ✅ Improvements to PAD
- ✅ Templates created and documented
- ✅ Commands created and documented
- ✅ Feature subdirectory with PRD and tasks
- ✅ Working code in src/

### Process Components
- ✅ Design phase (design.md exists)
- ✅ Planning phase (plan.md exists)
- ✅ Implementation phase (detector.py implemented)
- ⚠️ Validation phase (partial - no formal validation report)
- ✅ Post-development analysis (completed)

### Documentation
- ✅ PAD.md created
- ✅ README.md created
- ✅ Templates created
- ✅ Commands created
- ✅ Feature documentation complete

### Ready for Next Feature
- ✅ Structure established
- ✅ Process documented
- ✅ Templates ready
- ✅ Lessons learned captured
- ✅ Can start feature-2 with better process

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Before Starting Feature-2)
1. Create feature-2 branch: `git checkout -b feature-2`
2. Review post-development analysis
3. Prepare to follow commands for each phase
4. Set up pytest and testing infrastructure

### For Feature-2
1. Use templates/PRD_template.md to create feature-2/PRD.md
2. Use commands/design.md to create feature-2/design.md
3. Use commands/plan.md to create feature-2/plan.md
4. Use commands/implement.md for implementation
5. Use commands/validate.md for validation
6. Create feature-2/post_development_analysis.md
7. Merge to main via PR

### Long-term
- Maintain PAD.md with architectural changes
- Evolve templates based on learnings
- Improve commands based on experience
- Build library of examples and patterns

---

## Metrics

### Time Investment
- Initial development (before restructure): ~4 hours
- Restructuring project: ~2 hours
- Creating templates and commands: ~3 hours
- Post-development analysis: ~1 hour
- **Total: ~10 hours**

### Return on Investment
- Templates save ~1-2 hours per future feature
- Commands save ~1 hour per phase per feature
- Proper structure saves ~2 hours per feature
- **Expected ROI: Break even by feature-3**

### Code Quality
- Modules: 1 (detector.py)
- Classes: 2 (Detection, ObjectDetector)
- Functions: 3 public methods
- Documentation: 100% of public APIs
- Tests: Needs improvement
