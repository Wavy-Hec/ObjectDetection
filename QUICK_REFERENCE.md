## How to Start Feature-2

```bash
# 1. Create branch
git checkout -b feature-2

# 2. Create feature directory
mkdir -p feature-2/tasks

# 3. Copy and fill PRD template
cp templates/PRD_template.md feature-2/PRD.md
# Edit feature-2/PRD.md with requirements

# 4. Use design command
cat commands/design.md
# Use the prompt with AI to create feature-2/design.md

# 5. Use plan command  
cat commands/plan.md
# Use the prompt with AI to create feature-2/plan.md

# 6. Create task files
# Use templates/task_template.md for each task

# 7. Implement each task
cat commands/implement.md
# Follow the guidelines for each task

# 8. Validate feature
cat commands/validate.md
# Run comprehensive validation

# 9. Post-development analysis
# Create feature-2/post_development_analysis.md

# 10. Merge to main
git checkout main
git merge feature-2
git push origin main
```

## Testing the Current Code

```bash
# Activate environment
conda activate object_tracking

# Run detector test
python src/detector.py

# Expected output:
# ObjectDetector initialized on cuda (or cpu)
# Model: yolov5s.pt, Confidence threshold: 0.25
# Target classes: {'person', 'car'}
# Test detection completed.
```

---

## What Works Now

✅ Environment setup (conda)  
✅ YOLOv5s detector module  
✅ Detection class for bounding boxes  
✅ GPU/CPU auto-detection  
✅ Filtering by class and confidence  
✅ Comprehensive documentation  

---

## What Needs Work

⏳ SORT tracker implementation  
⏳ Integration pipeline (main.py)  
⏳ Comprehensive test suite  
⏳ Performance benchmarking  
⏳ CLI interface  
⏳ Visualization  

---

## Important Commands

```bash
# Environment
conda activate object_tracking
conda deactivate

# Git workflow
git checkout -b feature-X      # Start new feature
git add -A                     # Stage all changes
git commit -m "message"        # Commit changes
git push origin branch-name    # Push to remote

# Testing (when tests exist)
pytest tests/ -v               # Run all tests
pytest tests/ --cov=src        # Check coverage

# Code quality
python src/module.py           # Run module standalone
```

## Files You'll Create for Feature-2

```
feature-2/
├── PRD.md                      # Requirements (from template)
├── design.md                   # Architecture (use command)
├── plan.md                     # Task breakdown (use command)
├── post_development_analysis.md # After completion
└── tasks/
    ├── task-1.md               # Individual tasks (from template)
    ├── task-2.md
    └── task-3.md
```

## Common Questions

**Q: Should I update PAD.md for feature-2?**  
A: Only if you're changing architecture. Most features won't need PAD updates.

**Q: Can I modify the templates?**  
A: Yes! Update them based on what you learn. Document changes in post-dev analysis.

**Q: Do I need a branch for each feature?**  
A: Yes! Never work directly on main. Branches keep work organized.

**Q: How detailed should task files be?**  
A: Detailed enough that someone (or AI) can implement without asking questions.

**Q: When do I run validation?**  
A: After all tasks are complete, before merging to main.
