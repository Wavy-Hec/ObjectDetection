## For Your Discussion/Presentation

### What to Show

1. **Project Structure** - Show the organized directories
   ```bash
   ls -la
   # Show: PAD.md, templates/, commands/, feature-1/, src/, tests/
   ```

2. **Templates** - Explain how they work
   ```bash
   cat templates/PRD_template.md
   # Show how templates guide future work
   ```

3. **Testing** - Demonstrate tests passing
   ```bash
   pytest tests/ -v
   # Show all 10 tests passing
   ```

4. **Coverage** - Show code quality
   ```bash
   pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=term
   # Show 65% coverage (working toward 80%)
   ```

5. **Post-Dev Analysis** - Show lessons learned
   ```bash
   cat feature-1/post_development_analysis.md
   # Show comprehensive reflection
   ```

### Key Points to Discuss

1. **Workflow Evolution**
   - Started messy, restructured properly
   - Created templates for consistency
   - Built commands for AI collaboration

2. **Lessons Learned**
   - Structure first saves time later
   - Templates enable rapid feature development
   - Testing from day one is crucial
   - Post-dev analysis captures knowledge

3. **Process Improvements**
   - Feature branches (didn't do for feature-1, will for feature-2)
   - Test-driven development
   - Validation before merging
   - Continuous documentation

4. **ROI of Structure**
   - ~2 hours overhead to restructure
   - Will save 1-2 hours per future feature
   - Breaks even by feature-3
   - Knowledge preserved for future self

## When Ready for Feature-2

### Step 1: Create Feature Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature-2
```

### Step 2: Create Feature Directory
```bash
mkdir -p feature-2/tasks
```

### Step 3: Write PRD
```bash
cp templates/PRD_template.md feature-2/PRD.md
# Edit feature-2/PRD.md
# Define requirements for SORT tracker
```

### Step 4: Create Design
```bash
# Read commands/design.md
cat commands/design.md
# Use the AI prompt to create feature-2/design.md
```

### Step 5: Create Plan
```bash
# Read commands/plan.md
cat commands/plan.md
# Use the AI prompt to create feature-2/plan.md
# Break into tasks
```

### Step 6: Implement with Tests
```bash
# For each task:
# 1. Read commands/implement.md
# 2. Create src/tracker.py
# 3. Create tests/test_tracker.py
# 4. Run pytest after each change
# 5. Maintain >80% coverage
```

### Step 7: Validate
```bash
# Read commands/validate.md
# Run comprehensive validation
# Create validation report
```

### Step 8: Post-Dev Analysis
```bash
# Create feature-2/post_development_analysis.md
# Document learnings
# Update templates/commands if needed
```

### Step 9: Merge
```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature-2
git push origin main
```

---

## Testing Workflow Going Forward

### During Development
```bash
# Run tests frequently
pytest tests/test_tracker.py -v

# Check coverage often
pytest tests/ --cov=src
```

### Before Committing
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Verify coverage >80%
pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=term
```

### Before Merging
```bash
# Full validation
pytest tests/ -v --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Review coverage report
firefox htmlcov/index.html

# Fix any issues
```
