## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: NumPy Deprecation Warnings
**Problem:** Array-to-scalar conversion warnings in _z_to_bbox  
**Solution:** Used `.flat[i]` indexing to extract scalar values  
**Learning:** Stay updated with NumPy best practices

### Challenge 2: Test Isolation
**Problem:** Global KalmanBoxTracker.count persisted across tests  
**Solution:** Modified tests to not rely on absolute ID values  
**Learning:** Design tests to be order-independent

### Challenge 3: Track Confirmation Logic
**Problem:** Understanding min_hits vs hit_streak  
**Solution:** Studied SORT paper, clarified logic in tests  
**Learning:** Document algorithm details in code comments

### Challenge 4: Dependency Installation
**Problem:** filterpy not in initial environment  
**Solution:** Installed via pip, documented in plan.md  
**Learning:** Update environment.yml for future setups
