## What I Built: Effective AI Coding Workflow

### The Problem
Started with files scattered in root directory, no templates, no structured process. Realized after initial development that I needed to restructure to follow the required format.

### The Solution
Created a complete workflow system:

1. **Templates** - Reusable starting points for each feature
2. **Commands** - AI assistant prompts for each development phase
3. **Feature Directories** - Organized storage for each iteration
4. **PAD** - Central architectural source of truth
5. **Process** - Repeatable steps from requirements to validation

### The Workflow

```
For Each Feature:
├── 1. Create branch (git checkout -b feature-X)
├── 2. Design Phase
│   ├── Copy templates/PRD_template.md → feature-X/PRD.md
│   ├── Fill in requirements
│   ├── Use commands/design.md prompt
│   └── Create feature-X/design.md
├── 3. Planning Phase
│   ├── Use commands/plan.md prompt
│   ├── Create feature-X/plan.md
│   └── Break into tasks (feature-X/tasks/)
├── 4. Implementation Phase
│   ├── For each task:
│   │   ├── Use commands/implement.md prompt
│   │   ├── Write code in src/
│   │   ├── Write tests in tests/
│   │   └── Validate task completion
│   └── All tasks complete
├── 5. Validation Phase
│   ├── Use commands/validate.md prompt
│   ├── Run comprehensive tests
│   ├── Measure performance
│   └── Create validation report
├── 6. Post-Development Analysis
│   ├── Document what was learned
│   ├── Update templates based on experience
│   ├── Update commands based on what worked
│   ├── Identify improvements for next iteration
│   └── Create feature-X/post_development_analysis.md
└── 7. Merge to main
```

## Key Learnings

### Process Insights

1. **Structure First, Code Second**
   - Spending time on templates saves hours later
   - Proper directory structure prevents confusion
   - Templates ensure consistency across features

2. **Commands Enable AI Collaboration**
   - Clear prompts get better AI assistance
   - Checklists prevent missing important steps
   - Examples guide implementation

3. **Feature Branches Matter**
   - Should have created feature-1 branch initially
   - Main branch should stay stable
   - Easier to track feature-specific changes

4. **Test Continuously**
   - Writing tests after code is harder
   - TDD would have caught issues earlier
   - Coverage targets keep quality high

5. **Document as You Go**
   - Easier than documenting afterwards
   - Captures decisions while fresh
   - Helps future self understand choices

### Technical Insights

1. **Modular Design Pays Off**
   - Detector is reusable and testable
   - Clear interfaces make integration easier
   - Separation of concerns aids understanding

2. **Configuration > Hardcoding**
   - Should externalize more constants
   - Makes testing easier
   - Enables different use cases

3. **Error Handling Critical**
   - Need more robust error handling
   - Helpful error messages save debugging time
   - Edge cases need explicit handling

## Evolution of Templates and Commands

### What I Started With
- Loose files, no structure
- No templates
- No commands
- Ad-hoc process

### What I Have Now
- Organized directory structure
- Comprehensive templates for PRDs and tasks
- Commands for all four development phases
- Repeatable, documented process

### What I'll Improve for Feature-2
- Add more examples to templates
- Include automated validation scripts
- Create checklist-based commands
- Add code review guidelines
- Set up CI/CD pipeline

## Metrics

### Time Investment
| Activity | Time | Value |
|----------|------|-------|
| Initial development | 4h | Code that works |
| Restructuring | 2h | Proper organization |
| Templates creation | 3h | Reusable for all features |
| Commands creation | 3h | Reusable for all features |
| Analysis & docs | 1h | Learning captured |
| **Total** | **13h** | **Complete workflow** |

### ROI Analysis
- Templates save ~1-2h per feature (will pay off by feature-2)
- Commands save ~1h per phase (immediate value)
- Structure saves ~2h per feature (prevents confusion)
- **Expected break-even: Feature-3**

### Code Quality
- Modules: 1 (detector.py)
- Lines: ~128
- Coverage: ~20% (needs improvement)
- Documentation: 100% of public APIs
- PEP 8 compliance: High
